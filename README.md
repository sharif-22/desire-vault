## Project Title

DesireVault

## Description

DesireVault is a collaborative product watchlist app developed for a hackathon project. It allows users to create, manage, and share lists of products they desire to purchase or keep track of. The app is built with React.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for real-time collaborative features. Users can add products to their watchlists, mark them as purchased, and collaborate with others on shared lists.

With real-time collaborative features powered by Firebase. With Desire Vault, users can stay organized, discover new products, and streamline their shopping experience.
