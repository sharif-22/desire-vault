## Project Title

Desire Vault

## Description

Desire Vault is a collaborative product watchlist app developed for a hackathon project. It allows users to create, manage, and share lists of products they desire to purchase or keep track of. The app is built with React.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for real-time collaborative features. Users can add products to their watchlists, mark them as purchased, and collaborate with others on shared lists.
